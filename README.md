# Check if a Linked List Has a Cycle in Python

I also have a step by step walkthrough of this challenge available on my [my blog](https://kalbartal.net/longest-substring-with-no-repeating-characters-in-python/).

This repository contains the source code and solution to a problem that asks you to determine if a linked list contains a cycle. To solve this problem, one can use two pointers - the “slow” pointer and the “fast” pointer. With the help of these pointers, the algorithm can traverse through the list to check if any node points back to a previous one. 

## Installation
